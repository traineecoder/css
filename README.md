# Notes:
## CSS
CSS can implemented in three ways:
<ul>
    <li>External</li>
    <li>Internal</li>
    <li>In-line</li>
</ul>
In External styling, the sheets are creating elswhere and linked to the html, Internal styling is implemented using 'style' tag inside 'head' of html and Inline styles are added by using style attribute on tags.<br>
Internal and External sheets override each other based on their placement in 'head' tag of html.<br>
Inline overrides both internal and External.<br>
It is best to Use External way of implementing styles, As it is more managable.<br>
